# Security-Townhall-Dec-2018

Presentation around fixed and growth mindsets , for the security community.
Includes two videos that I removed from the presentation because of file size.

Voiceover notes not in the presentation
Why are these concepts so important for this community ?
  1. Positive goal and negative goal world
      Positive : You *can* access the file ----> easy to verify. 
      Negative: You *cannot* assess the file ----> hard to verify because you must figure out all ways to prevent this.
  This implies iteration , and learning via growth mindsets.
As a human, you are complex so...
  You are never one thing, rather you are more in that dimension.  
    E.g. You are an extrovert really means mostly, you are an extrovert. You can have introvert moments.
    The same holds for fixed and growth mindsets....
